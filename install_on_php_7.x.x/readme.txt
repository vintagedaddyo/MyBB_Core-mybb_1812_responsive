Quick file updates to overwrite in resources so as to simply install the pkg on php7.x.x

This was quickly tried on: 
MyBB Version 	1.8.12 	
PHP Version 	7.3.4


You must use these files install/resources/mysql_db_tables.php & install/resources/mysql_db_inserts.php to overwrite existing files of the same name in the existing pkg

This was done primarily just to see a demo of the past project on my current localhost
